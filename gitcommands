Important points/topic in git:
*). what is HEAD in git?
When working with Git, only one branch can be checked out at a time - and this is what's called the "HEAD" branch.
HEAD is a symbolic reference pointing to wherever you are in your commit history.
It follows you wherever you go, whatever you do, like a shadow.
If you make a commit, HEAD will move. If you checkout something, HEAD will move. Whatever you do, if you have moved somewhere new in your commit history, HEAD has moved along with you.
